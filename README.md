# Alura-Data-Immersion-3
Alura.com.br is a Brazilian platform of online courses with an annual subscription.
On Monday 3 May, they started the 3rd edition of "Imersao Dados" which translates to "Data Immersion". Until the 7th May there will be lessons and challenges everyday, with a few lives on YouTube too.
We will learn how Data Science and Machine Learning can help with drug discovery.

All the content is in Portuguese, but I will be translating it to English.

One modification I do whenever working with Jupyter Notebook, is to change the custom.css adding the following: 

.end_space {
  height: 75vh;
}

It allows to keep the last cell at the top.
